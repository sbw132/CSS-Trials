    I have been a students at The Flatiron School for under a month. I learned html in college and set up my own website then for commerical interactions. 
    In the interim of some 17+ years that have elapsed since then, I have found that I need a refresher as I don't code in my daily life. Also, coding has changed quite a bit since then.
